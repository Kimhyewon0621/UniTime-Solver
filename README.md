# UniTime-Solver
> **UniTime-Solver** is a Java-based automatic timetable generator for university students.
> We help students find the best schedule combinations without the headache of manual arrangement.


## Project Overview 
>Every semester, university students suffer from arranging their timetables. Balancing required major courses with desired electives while avoiding time conflicts is a complex constraint satisfaction problem.
**UniTime-Solver** acts as your smart assistant. It doesn't just give you a fixed result; it collaborates with you.

## Key Features
- **Input from User:** Allows users to clearly segment and input mandatory and optional courses.
- **Backtracking:** Algorithm Uses DFS-based recursion to generate all valid timetable combinations.
- **User Interface (UI):** Provides a highly readable timetable list in the console environment using ANSI codes, including **pagination** for large result sets.
- **Editor** Allows the user to edit the result timetables by modifying course lists.
